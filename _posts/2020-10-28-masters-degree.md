After finishing my bachelor of science in "Visual Computing and Design" in 2016 I worked for well over four years as a Software Engineer at Daimler TSS GmbH in Ulm and Stuttgart. This month I started studying computer science with focus on software engineering at the HTWG Konstanz. So far, I really like it.
