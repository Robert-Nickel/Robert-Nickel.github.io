**Doing agile:** We do understand, that every team member is selfish, has poor communication skills and insufficient
knowledge to solve an undefined problem that everyone pretends to understand in a predictable amount of
time.  
  
Therefore we are shifting the focus from believing the experts and their plans to learning, experimenting
and repeatedly checking something useful gets done. And we do test-driven SAFe T-shaped daily pair
programming Kanban with our Scrum PO.  
  
P.S. We don't do documentation, because we value working software more.
