    <p><strong>Scrum:</strong> A highly selling agile framework that is based on a prerequisite that is impossible to fulfill: knowing how long a chunk of work will take to complete [1]. It is all so great!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Autonomous teams that are told to do Scrum.</li>
  <li>Early feedback and improved communications, but only after two weeks.</li>
  <li>“Measuring the velocity” by relying on estimates. Everyone knew this already, when the estimates were done.</li>
  <li>A Scrum Master that doesn’t require any skill or experience in order to have “master” in his job title.</li>
  <li>The highest adoption of all agile frameworks, except no one “really” does Scrum, because it “doesn’t really fit in this particular context”, and therefore “we are doing Scrum OUR way”.</li>
</ul>
