    A lot of people do retrospectives. A lot of teams do that on a regular basis. They sit down, think about
    the
    last two weeks or so, identify problems they have had and find action items to improve.</br>
    That is super cool.</br></br>
    What we did today, went one step further: We thought about the problem we tried to solve in the past two
    years with our product. Having the problem in mind we brainstormed on how we could solve the problem,
    not
    thinking of our current solution at all. We reset our brains, including all of the domain language,
    business
    rules and other burdensome legacy concepts.</br></br>
    This. Was. Awesome.</br></br>
    The concept: Let us do two full day design thinking-ish meetings. First day: Brainstorming, throwing
    "the
    big five "topics out. Then splitting up and grooming in pairs and presenting the results to everyone.
    Second
    day: Trying to be more structured and start thinking on a high level, considering the ideas of the first
    day, and refining into more detail. Result: Eventually we found a cool way to solve our business
    problem,
    which was not related at all with the solution we had in place. It was totally mind-blowing, how we
    could do
    the same stuff we did the past two years a lot better than before.</br></br>
    Next steps: By mapping the status quo with the target state, we want to identify the concepts that are
    different and those, that are similar, on which level, and why. For those concepts that are far apart:
    Which
    were the historic reasons to make the decisions, that led to a the status quo? Is the solution, we have
    in
    our heads now, really better, than the one, we have implemented? For those areas, where we had no shiny
    new
    ideas: Were we really open minded, or is it really the only way to solve this problem? Then we go
    quickly
    into the direction of making things concrete, by iterating over all the necessary steps: Starting from
    clarifications with the legal department, marketing people and other stakeholders, getting a more
    precise
    understanding of the solutions we are going to implement, having scribbles of the screens,
    implementation in
    code and so on.. as meantioned: all iterative.</br></br>
    Okay, now the truth: It was not awesome at all.</br></br>
    It was super difficult to let go all of the known, and most people, maybe all, actually did not manage
    to
    rethink concepts from scratch they had already solved. It actually hurt to see a lot of complexity,
    which we
    put a lot of effort in, just flushing. People had developed close relationships with "their" solutions,
    and
    felt attacked by questioning everything. We did not finish within the time we expected, and people
    questioned, if we should actually continue with this format, because all of it was so heavy and took so
    long. And then there was this constant: "Man, why didn&rsquo;t we do this one year ago?"
