I worked 4,5 Years (2016-2020) at Daimler TSS GmbH in Ulm and in Stuttgart. It was my first fulltime software engineering job and I learned a lot about backend development with Spring Boot, Android app development, Golang, collaboration within development teams and between software engineers and designers, agile practices and big companies.

Among other internal and external projects, I participated in *Private Car Sharing*, an app to share your Mercedes-Benz car with friends and family without having to provide them a key.
