&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-mxYrCNX60&quot;&gt;pigeonhole principle&lt;/a&gt;. A pigeonhole is where
pigeons like to sit. I started liking it, when I discovered, that it is so obvious in the metaphor but, at
least for me, took a while to become able to really apply it. The pigeon metaphor goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one hole will host at least two pigeons.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üê¶ ‚Äì üì≠&lt;br /&gt;
üê¶ ‚Äì üì≠&lt;br /&gt;
üê¶ -¬¥&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obvious, but&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many people in Sydney have the same amount of hair on their head?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets estimate the maximum amount of hair: 150K. In Sydney live around 5.3M people.
&lt;strong&gt;Preliminary conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: At least 2 people in Sydney have the exact same amount of hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pigeonhole principle goes further: It also tells us, how many people (at least) in Sydney have the same
amount of hair. Just divide the pigeons by the pigeonholes and ceil the number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.3M / 150K ~= 35,3 ceiled to 36.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: At least 36 people in Sydney have the exact same amount of hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe there are many real world situations, in which the pigeonhole principle makes a lot of sense, and I cannot
wait to stumble across some of them. To be honest: For this example, it would be more effective to count (or estimate)
the amount of bald people, assuming they are the biggest group with the same amount of hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homework&lt;/strong&gt;: At my wedding we had 125 guests. There were 6 different main courses and 3 different side dishes, and each
guest took one main course and one side dish on their plate. How many people at least had the exact same meal?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Thinking" /><summary type="html">While learning for my discrete mathematics exam, I stumbled across the pigeonhole principle.

metaphor of lumberjacking. A forester, who represents the product owner, leads a team of lumberjacks,
which is the development team, to the most important trees to cut down. The trees represent features or
stories. How is this metaphor valuable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://robertnickel.online/2020/03/08/segregating-responsibility.html&quot;&gt;Segregation of responsibility&lt;/a&gt;: One marks the trees to cut, the others define how and do cut them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The lumberjacks who have the strength, skills and tools to cut down trees, although not everyone is on the same level of experience, so they help each other out. Some trees can be cut alone, others need to be cut together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The forester pays the team of lumberjacks to cut down trees, so that he can futher explore the infinite forest of valuable trees.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In order to collaborate, mutual respect for the counterpart‚Äôs discipline is required. Discussions and proposals are valuable and humility is a prerequisite, but the circles of competence are known and respected.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The lumberjacks are able to state concerns: It could be dangerous to cut down a tree, because of uncertainty where the tree will fall. Risks, depending on what is on the line (another tree? A human?), need to be evaluated strategically and should be reduced on the long run.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The forester can ask questions: Do you think, we can chop this tree safely already, or do we need to chop another tree first?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CYA concerns are resolved easier: It is either the wrong tree, or it is the wrong way to cut it down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No one is perfect: Sometimes a tree is mouldy (=&amp;gt; wrong feature), sometimes the chopping takes longer than expected (=&amp;gt; unexpected technical complexity).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some trees are in the way and need to be cut down in order to get to the ‚Äògood‚Äô trees.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The forester doesn‚Äôt tell the lumberjacks to sharpen their chainsaw or axes (=&amp;gt; write tests, update IDE‚Äôs etc.): They know and do it themselves, better than the forester could. They will do it within the working hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is dangerous to cut trees. It is important to have safety precautions and stick to them (=&amp;gt; QA).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After a tree is chopped, the work is not done (=&amp;gt; definition of done): It needs to be cut into smaller pieces and carried away. Then the wood goes trough a number of procedures (=&amp;gt; build pipeline) in order to be made valuable. Sometimes the value is to give shelter, craft furniture or build a ship, sometimes it just gives comfy warmth in front of a fireplace. The foresters intention might materialize here (=&amp;gt; business value).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I do not know so much about lumberjacking or foresting, so forgive my oversimplification and maybe misconceptions. The goal is to write about software engineering metaphorically, and I find some concepts easy to understand using these wooden examples. I have a more detailled and less metaphorical article about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertnickel.online/2020/03/08/segregating-responsibility.html&quot;&gt;segregation of responsibility here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Agile" /><summary type="html">To illustrate 12 very important aspects of agile software engineering, I want to use the oversimplified metaphor of lumberjacking.

wrote a code of law, the so called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi&quot;&gt;Code of Hammurabi&lt;/a&gt;,
which holds some surprisingly effective thoughts regarding the contract between a landlord and a house
builder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄûIf a builder build a house for a man and complete it, (that man) shall give him two shekels of silver
per SAK [a length unit] of house as his wage.‚Äú [1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bigger house costs more money. But isn‚Äòt it interesting, how the house builder is not paid depending
on the time it took to build it? There is no hourly rate, which means, the landlord wont get any unhappy financial surprises, which is good. But wait a second! Doesn‚Äòt that mean, that a house builder will do anything as fast and cheap as possible, wouldn‚Äôt that be a catastrophy? He might put those people in danger, who want to live in this house later on. The key question is: How can the owner of the house assure, that it has a good quality, if he only pays depending on the size of the house?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hammurabi thought about this, did some risk management, and solved this ‚Äûquick and dirty‚Äú approach by
the following law:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄûIf a builder build a house for a man and do not make its construction firm, and the house which he has built collapse and cause the death of the owner of the house, that builder shall be put to death. If it cause the death of a son of the owner of the house, they shall put to death a son of that builder.‚Äú [2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no need to explain, that the house builders will do their absolute best to prevent houses to
collapse and kill someone, because they have so much skin in the game for an unlimited amount of time, meaning they can be killed because a house collapsed, they built 20 years ago. How exactly assured Hammurabi the quality of houses? By closing a feedback loop for the craftmanship of house building. Those who are really good at building houses will be able to keep building houses, while those who fail doing that will be stopped putting peoples live in danger. It might sound like a cruel practice from our modern cultural perspective, but it led to ridiculously good houses, there is no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The house building quality solution is not a solution for house building anymore, maybe because of technological advancement and regulations, but I believe we can learn a lot from Hammurabis structural solution here. He shows us, that we need to close the feedback loop and reduce its complexity. This is, in my opinion, the single most important task of agile software processes. What I mean goes far beyond &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/enterprise-strategy/enterprise-devops-why-you-should-run-what-you-build/&quot;&gt;‚ÄûYou build it, you run it.‚Äú&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example: A software architect, who does architectural work on a project and then leaves over to the next project, has zero skin in the game of the old project, and is therefore hardly able to improve. In a frictionless world, this architect would maybe get verbal feedback from people on the lower technical levels, that experience the actual haptical feedback that result from his decisions. But in the real world, complexity, reputation and hierarchy fog this verbal feedback, which complicates improvement for the architect further.
And this is just one example for the concept of closed feedback loops, and therefore having skin in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets enhance our motto: ‚ÄûYou build it, you run it .. and you bleed for it.‚Äú, where bleeding is metaphorical
for all the (negative) consequences that result from our decisions. It may be a phone call in the middle of the night, it may be doing overtime that originates in our own mistakes or might be getting fired. Especially the last point might sound extreme on the first glance, but think about this on a theoretical level first: Do you really want to build a team, in which people don‚Äôt experience negative feedback on their own
actions? Do you prefer working with people who survived the sometimes brutal reality, or would you rather work
with people that have set up (and used!) safety nets a little too often? Please get this right: I am all for improvement that is based and being able to fail and learn. In order to be able to innovate, it is crucial to have playgrounds with limited consequences to failure. On the other hand I am worried, that an extensive lack of consequences will lead weak software craftsmen, who build houses that collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, of course, be aware! Don‚Äòt let someone else put YOUR skin in HIS game. It has happend more than once, that a release plan, that was promised by a project manager led to overtime for engineers, or that product owners are blamed for quality issues, that were caused by ‚ÄûI will fix it later‚Äú minded engineers. See my article &lt;a href=&quot;http://robertnickel.online#segregating-responsibility&quot;&gt;The Two Dimensions of an Increment&lt;/a&gt; to get more detail on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

I experienced a very unclear understanding of this topic on both sides, which usually leads to wrong decisions and poor quality. I believe the proposed model will lead to a better sense of responsibility and therefore greater results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets start by some definitions: An increment can be everything between a whole product, that was
developed for years to a small feature that was developed in the last iteration/sprint.
It has many dimensions. For this model we need only two of them: the business perspective (also referred
to as functional), and the technical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/increment_dimensions.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business people are those that work on the business perspective of an increment, by defining and refining the problem, doing business research, talking to stakeholders etc; they answer the ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù. In scrum these are the product owners (POs). Technical people on the other hand are those who tackle the technical perspective on an increment. They develop a solution to a problem, by answering the ‚Äúhow?‚Äù. And they work in a team, why not call them ‚Äútech team‚Äù for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the tech team says, they want to do a technical task that does not directly provide business value,
but is necessary to keep the system alive, what should happen? Should the product owner agree to do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tech team as a whole is responsible for everything that happens on the technical dimension, including a sufficient level of quality (‚ÄúWe do not deliver Shyt!‚Äù), operations and security issues. Other examples are architectural, programming language and cloud platform related decisions, and there are many more. Since it is ‚Äútheir‚Äù solution to the problem, you call the tech team in the middle of the night, when the software isn‚Äôt  running! Additionally, they are the only ones that know how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the business people should not actively agree to the technical task, that was mentioned
earlier; they shouldn‚Äôt bother at all! The questions that are asked on the business dimension are often similar to ‚ÄúWhat do we need to do?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is our (functional!) priority?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhen will we be done with this stage of the backlog?‚Äù and ‚ÄúShould I take this as one feature, or rather split it into two?‚Äù. The business people should decide everything, that belongs to the business perspective, and shouldn‚Äôt decide anything that does not belong to that dimension. If they would do the latter, they would take away the responsibility of people, who are better at doing that, which is a guarantuee for a loss of value from a wholesome standpoint. The business peoples decision making power starts and ends at business questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very clean and structural (and massively simplified!) solution to a typically ‚Äúunclean‚Äù
problem. I have worked with engineers who believe, it isn‚Äôt their responsibility to take actions on technical topics, because they do not feel responsibile. The technical debt piles up, which leads to quality issues and paralyzation in the development process. But they want to get told by the business people, or at least get allowance, to deliver good quality. That is not what being a craftsman and taking responsibility looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, I have seen customers and managers, who believe that the business people are responsible for everything, even technical things like architecture and quality. And of course, as common as the ‚Äúunresponsible engineer‚Äù is the ‚ÄúI-will-take-it-all-business-person‚Äù, who wants to decide on huge technical decisions or backlog items based on a two minute explanation. This persons often ‚Äúallows‚Äù the tech team to decide on the smaller issues, because he ‚Äútrusts‚Äù them with that. He mixes up the two given dimensions of an increment with importance or size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make this more clear, think of the following example: As a member of the tech team, I have to keep my operating system up to date and secure all the time. On the long term, there is no way around it in order to be able to develop a feature, and I am responsible to do this. The very important question here is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why am I responsible for doing this very small technical thing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it because it is a technical thing to do, or is it, because it is a small thing? If the answer is the former: Great. Scale that up. You don‚Äôt need to read this any further. If the answer is, because it is a quick and small thing, than you have that unclean structural problem that was mentioned above. There is no exact way in determining beforehand if a task is above or below a given threshold in size, complexity, importance, criticality etc. It is a subjective and discussable thing, that depends on experience, perspective and even the mood of people. At this point one could be tempted to think: ‚ÄúIf it is close to that threshold, I will know if it is in my area of responsibility or not.‚Äù. Yes, you might, but someone else might have a
different perception, and this relies by far to much on that subjective metric. A very clear segregation in responsibility, between the business perspective and the technical perspective
(and people who are well aware of it) is a good thing that leads to great results in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One is responsible who has the power to make decisions, is affected by the consequences and has to deal with the reaction to those.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to embrace the segregation of responsibility, I propose that you start by cleaning up your backlog (or any other form of todo list you have). Group the items in ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù and ‚Äútechnical‚Äù. If some items are on the edge between those two, focus on the functional aspects first and kick out the technical questions or decisions, they will follow. The functional items are the reign of the business people. If you are one of them: This is the area you can make decisions on, and you have to take the full responsibility for your decision. This is your area of influence, doing a great job here will be easier without having all those technical aspects in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now have a look at all the technical items. What you see is the reign of tech team.
If you are part of the tech team: This is what you decide and take the responsibility for. Ask yourself
for every legacy item you have: Which problem does my technical item solve, and is that really necessary and relevant? Clean up and discuss it with the other tech team members. You have to see the whole picture (the beyond-sprint-perspective), because you will be accountable for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to get this right. I am not proposing to reduce the communication between business people and technical people. As a technical person, it often is a good idea to challenge business requirements. The technical people will sometimes have to justify, why they decide for a specific framework or why you
want to switch the programming language etc. But by all the technical decisions you do and execute, you should always (at least every iteration) also deliver things. Have in mind: the tools you use, are tools to solve a problem.
Tools are not useful without a problem to solve. Talk to each other :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One concern I have often heard: How can you take away the responsibilty for big and time consuming technical  backlog items from the business people? They will need to meet agreements and make promises about release dates etc.! That is a valid question, and the answer is underwhelming: A technical decision is equally not in their responsibility, as protecting the engineers from getting hit by a bus. They simply cannot control it, and they shouldn‚Äôt. At this point, business people have to let go the urge to control that and trust the tech team, which will deliver solutions, which will lead to more trust. It is an upward flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that this clarification about the dimensions of an increment, that should be taken into consideration  when taking responsibility for a software project in any role, helps to build highly valuable software with less stress for every involved person. Please keep in mind, that the more formal segregation I propse is no silver bullet. It is just a small piece in the big puzzle of software development, that can only work, if you have a non-broken tech team, that is abled and willing to take responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Agile" /><summary type="html">This post discusses the segregation of responsibility of an increment between technical people and business people.

I believe the proposed model will lead to a better sense of responsibility and therefore greater results.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/assets/images/apple.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="/assets/images/apple.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The McDonald‚Äôs of Software Engineering</title><link href="/blog/scaling-innovation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The McDonald‚Äôs of Software Engineering" /><published>2019-08-29T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-08-29T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>/blog/scaling-innovation</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/scaling-innovation/">&lt;p&gt;Often when I tell people, that I am a Software Engineer, they explain their idea of a game changing app, but don‚Äôt know how to make it real. People backtrack when they find out about the cost of software development, because they fear the risk and often have no clue about this whole craftmansship. This does not mean, that the ideas are worthless, many of them are really good and some are actually game changing, I believe. So there is value, but no one picks it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is there no McSoftware that paves the way for low-budget projects to become real? It could be a franchising company with a world wide network of managers and lawyers, a great branding and very efficient value streams, just like the fast food restaurant equivalent McDonald‚Äôs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about this a lot, especially about the question, how I could build this. And I came to this result: If it would be achievable, someone would probably have achieved it already, or at least something similar. But that is not the case, as far as I know. The reason: software development barely scales. The software itself scales indefinitely, and therefore there is no reason to produce the same thing cheaper then the competitors. Software breathes innovation. And innovation does not scale at all, that is in its nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation in general is the effort of many but the success of few, and those Einsteins who get humanity to the next level might get the prestige and/or the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we get out of this? The bad news are, that you will need to have the game changing idea &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the resources to make it real. But on the other hand, due to higher level programming languages, reusable components and frameworks, better ways of teaching and learning technology and more digital natives with upcoming generations, it is getting cheaper and more accessible over time to develop innovative software that changes the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Thinking" /><summary type="html">Often when I tell people, that I am a Software Engineer, they explain their idea of a game changing app, but don‚Äôt know how to make it real.

We had the chance to set up parts of our methodology on our own, and one part was the question: &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúHow do we as a team want to estimate?‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was consciously expressed as a very open question, and a colleague of mine immediately responded: &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúIn hours please!‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;. Before this project, she was in a project where one story point was equal to two hours of work, and you get into trouble, if you take more than the estimated time. The improvement/simplification she proposed was to not divide by two (which sounds like a random number in this context) when estimating story points instead of hours. I do not want to discuss this way of estimating non-linear work here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question she answered was not: Should we estimate time, effort, complexity, risk, business value or something else, on which scale (Fibonacci numbers, natural numbers, binary..) and in which unit (hours, days, story points, T-Shirt sizes, our own scale, apples..)? Her perspective to the question was one dimensional (which factor per hour), in a multidimensional answer-space. I believe her answer was smart in that one dimension, but not useful, when considering more of the dimensions we know of. This is not her failure or stupidity, it is her experience with this world of ‚Äúagile‚Äù software development, and was extended in the next few minutes after other colleagues told their opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made me think: Am I answering multi-dimensional questions on a one-dimensional scale? Of course I do, basically everything I think of, I have to think in words I know and cannot think in languages or other concepts I have never heard of. In a lot of open questions, there are a lot of answers from dimensions I would never even consider, but are equally valid or much better than those I would consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means, that &lt;strong&gt;the quality of an answer&lt;/strong&gt; to an open question is not defined by the number of other answers
that were considered from the same dimension, but by &lt;strong&gt;the number of dimensions, that came into consideration in the thinking process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My colleague could not have found a great solution by trading off the number of hours per story point to be 1, 2, 3 or any other number, but we could find a good solution together, by exchanging thoughts and experience with other people, that do consider other dimensions. It is not easy to think out of the box, I therefore propose to visit other peoples boxes and have a curious look out of their windows. Also dare to step out onto their balconies. I think this is a basic concept in teamwork, friendship and family.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Thinking" /><summary type="html">I used to work in the same team for more than 2 years, and now I left and joined a much smaller team in a green field project.

A lot of teams do that on a regular basis. They sit down, think about the last two weeks or so, identify problems they have had and find action items to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is super cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we did today, went one step further: We thought about the problem we tried to solve in the past two years with our product. Having the problem in mind we brainstormed on how we could solve the problem, not thinking of our current solution at all. We reset our brains, including all of the domain language, business rules and other burdensome legacy concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This was awesome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept: Let us do two full day design thinking-ish meetings. First day: Brainstorming, throwing ‚Äúthe big five‚Äù topics out. Then splitting up and grooming in pairs and presenting the results to everyone. Second day: Trying to be more structured and start thinking on a high level, considering the ideas of the first day, and refining into more detail. Result: Eventually we found a cool way to solve our business problem, which was not related at all with the solution we had in place. It was totally mind-blowing, how we could do the same stuff we did the past two years a lot better than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next steps: By mapping the status quo with the target state, we want to identify the concepts that are different and those, that are similar, on which level, and why. For those concepts that are far apart: Which were the historic reasons to make the decisions, that led to a the status quo? Is the solution, we have in our heads now, really better than the one we have implemented? For those areas, where we had no shiny new ideas: Were we really open minded, or is it really the only way to solve this problem? Then we go quickly into the direction of making things concrete, by iterating over all the necessary steps: Starting from clarifications with the legal department, marketing people and other stakeholders, getting a more precise understanding of the solutions we are going to implement, having scribbles of the screens, implementation in code and so on.. as meantioned: all iterative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, now the truth: It was not awesome at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was super difficult to let go all of the known, and most people, maybe all, actually did not manage to rethink concepts from scratch they had already solved. It actually hurt to see a lot of complexity, which we put a lot of effort in, just flushing. People had developed close relationships with ‚Äútheir‚Äù solutions, and felt attacked by questioning everything. We did not finish within the time we expected, and people questioned, if we should actually continue with this format, because all of it was so heavy and took so long. And then there was this constant: ‚ÄúMan, why didn‚Äôt we do this one year ago?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Agile" /><summary type="html">A lot of people do retrospectives.
