Recently a friend asked, if there would be a RSS feed for my blog, since he finds my &lt;a href=&quot;/category/cynical-glossary/index.html&quot;&gt;cynical glossary&lt;/a&gt; a cool idea. I didn‚Äôt have one (&lt;a href=&quot;/feed.xml&quot;&gt;I have one now&lt;/a&gt;), so I did a little bit of research about RSS in general and then I stumbled across Jekyll (again). I knew that Github Pages supports Jekyll themes natively, but never gave it a try. It seemed easy to generate a RSS feed automatically with the plugin &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed&quot;&gt;Jekyll feed&lt;/a&gt;, so I gave it a try. First I had some difficulties to set Jekyll up locally, I think due to some Ruby versioning issues, so I started by just pushing my Jekyll code to Github. I could see changes quickly in case the compiled, but destroyed my blog if they didn‚Äôt, so.. I needed to get it running locally soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, I wanted to experiment more. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/&quot;&gt;documentation of Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is really good and readable to get started, and I found it quite easy to set everything up. I extracted my blog posts into seperate files markdown and html files, that are named after a certain pattern and located in a certain folder. Jekyll then understands that those texts are blog posts, and enables quite a lot of cool features for blogging such as the RSS feed plugin, I just had to turn it on. One aspect I particularly liked about Jekyll was the usage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.github.io/liquid&quot;&gt;liquid&lt;/a&gt;, which provides conditions, loops and variables/objects for HTML. For example: Instead of repeating HTML for the title of a blog post, I could simply extract that and use the variables of my page object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a href=&quot;{{ page.url }}&quot;&amp;gt;{{ page.title }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put this in a loop, together with the heading, text and signature of the post, and immediately all blog posts were rendered the expected way below each other. Jekyll generates static HTML out of the liquid HTML, so that it can be deployed on a static webserver. &lt;strong&gt;Liquid feels like improved HTML.&lt;/strong&gt; I worked a couple of days (not consistently) on the transition of my blog to Jekyll, and now I have some handy new features, that were easy to build, add and/or configure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/feed.xml&quot;&gt;The requested RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;, subscribe if you don‚Äôt want to miss any post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS&quot;&gt;read this&lt;/a&gt; if you want to know what it is&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blog posts have categories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blog posts can be filtered by category, just use the categories listed &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertnickel.online/blog.html&quot;&gt;at the top&lt;/a&gt;, or click on the category in the signature of the post&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blog posts have static urls (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertnickel.online/2021/01/06/experiment-jekyll.html&quot;&gt;https://robertnickel.online/2021/01/06/experiment-jekyll.html&lt;/a&gt;), just click on the title of a post to go there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I removed the ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù area, since it is a category now, that can be used as a filter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Jekyll is very lightweight, for example in comparision with WordPress. It is incredibely well documented and easy to start with (just push something to Github Pages). The terminology is intuitive and the usage of liquid enabled me to not repeat myself and have a scalable solution (in terms of adding content, categories, rss etc.). &lt;strong&gt;I recommend it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Robert Nickel</name></author><category term="Project" /><summary type="html">Since 2 years I am operating this blog as pure HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript, first on an Apache webserver, then on Github Pages.

    While learning for my discrete mathematics exam, I stumbled across the &lt;a
        href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-mxYrCNX60&quot;&gt;pigeonhole principle&lt;/a&gt;. A pigeonhole is where
    pigeons like to sit. I started liking it, when I discovered, that it is so obvious in the metaphor but, at
    least for me, took a while to become able to really apply it. The pigeon metaphor goes like this:
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;If there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one hole will host at least two pigeons.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
    üê¶&amp;nbsp;--&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;üì≠&lt;br&gt;
    üê¶&amp;nbsp;--&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;üì≠&lt;br&gt;
    üê¶&amp;nbsp;--¬¥&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Obvious.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Please tell me &lt;b&gt;how many people in Sydney have the same amount of hair on their head?&lt;/b&gt;
    Lets estimate the maximum amount of hair: 150K. In Sydney live around 5.3M people.
    &lt;b&gt;Preliminary conclusion&lt;/b&gt;: At least 2 people in Sydney have the exact same amount of hair.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The pigeonhole principle goes further: It also tells us, how many people (at least) in Sydney have the same
    amount of hair. Just divide the pigeons by the pigeonholes and ceil the number.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    5.3M / 150K ~= 35,3 ceiled to 36.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;: At least 36 people in Sydney have the exact same amount of hair.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    I believe there are many real world situations, in which the pigeonhole principle makes a lot of sense, and
    I cannot wait to stumble across some of them. To be honest: For this example, it would be more effective to
    count (or estimate) the amount of bald people, assuming they are the biggest group with the same amount of
    hair.
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Homework&lt;/b&gt;: At my wedding we had 125 guests. There were 6 different main courses and 3 different side
    dishes,
    and each guest took one main course and one side dish on their plate. How many people at least had the exact
    same meal?

    To illustrate 12 very important aspects of agile software engineering, I want to use the oversimplified
    metaphor of lumberjacking. A forester, who represents the product owner, leads a team of lumberjacks,
    which is the development team, to the most important trees to cut down. The trees represent features or
    stories. How is this metaphor valuable?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertnickel.online/thinking#segregating-responsibility&quot;&gt;Segregation of
            responsibility&lt;/a&gt;: One marks the trees to cut, the others define how and do cut them.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; The lumberjacks who have the strength, skills and tools to cut down trees, although not everyone is
        on the same level of experience, so they help each other out. Some trees can be cut alone, others need
        to be cut together.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; The forester pays the team of lumberjacks to cut down trees, so that he can futher explore the
        infinite
        forest of valuable trees.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; In order to collaborate, mutual respect for the counterpart&apos;s discipline is required. Discussions
        and
        proposals are valuable and humility is a prerequisite, but the circles of competence are known and
        respected.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; The lumberjacks are able to state concerns: It could be dangerous to cut down a tree, because of
        uncertainty where the tree will fall. Risks, depending on what is on the line (another tree? A
        human?),
        need to be evaluated strategically and should be reduced on the long run.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; The forester can ask questions: Do you think, we can chop this tree safely already, or do we
        need to chop another tree first?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; CYA concerns are resolved easier: It is either the wrong tree, or it is the wrong way to cut it
        down.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; No one is perfect: Sometimes a tree is mouldy (=&gt; wrong feature), sometimes the chopping takes
        longer
        than expected (=&gt; unexpected technical complexity).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some trees are in the way and need to be cut down in order to get to the &apos;good&apos; trees.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; The forester doesn&apos;t tell the lumberjacks to sharpen their chainsaw or axes (=&gt; write tests, update
        IDE&apos;s etc.): They know and do it themselves, better than the forester could. They will do it within
        the
        working hours.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; It is dangerous to cut trees. It is important to have safety precautions and stick to them (=&gt; QA).
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; After a tree is chopped, the work is not done (=&gt; definition of done): It needs to be cut into
        smaller
        pieces and carried away. Then the wood goes trough a number of procedures (=&gt; build pipeline) in
        order
        to
        be made valuable. Sometimes the value is to give shelter, craft furniture or build a ship, sometimes
        it
        just gives comfy warmth in front of a fireplace. The foresters intention might materialize here (=&gt;
        business value).
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; To be honest, I do not know so much about lumberjacking or foresting, so forgive my
    oversimplification and maybe misconceptions. The goal is to write about software engineering
    metaphorically,
    and I find some concepts easy to understand using these wooden examples. I have a more detailled and
    less
    metaphorical article about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertnickel.online/thinking#segregating-responsibility&quot;&gt;segregation
        of responsibility

    My younger brother tried to build a telegram bot, that gives him some information about his schedule,
    so he started, but stuck due to some infrastructure problems. I attempted to help him,
    and then basically took over the whole thing. I used claudia.js with its deployment and bot-builder
    features,
    and deployed it to AWS Lambda. Document based persistance happens using DynamoDB.

    You can test the bot here (imagine you are still at school):
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.me/MyScheduleRobot&quot;&gt;t.me/MyScheduleRobot&lt;/a&gt;

    Now some functional details: This bot is a schedule bot, it is not a calendar.
    To make the difference, and therefore what it does and what it doesn&apos;t, more clear:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;table-entry&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Schedule&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;table-entry&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Calendar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;table-entry&quot;&gt;Days repeat every week&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;table-entry&quot;&gt;Days are different every week&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;table-entry&quot;&gt;Timeslots repeat every day (üîî rings)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=&quot;table-entry&quot;&gt;Timeslots are vary a lot&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e8/ec/d1/e8ecd11f3c278afd7b3543a2b81fd1ea.png&quot;&gt;Compare
                this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.vertex42.com/calendars/images/monthly-calendar-with-combined-weekend.png&quot;&gt;with
                this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short high-level summary is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Define all the subjects (plus room, teacher etc.) you have, the timeslots (that repeat every day) and
        your timezone&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Configure your schedule, that is e.g. which subject you have first on monday, which second etc.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You get information for the whole week, just today, tomorrow or even now by chatting with the bot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use /help to get the detailed and always up-to-date list of things the bot can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Applying &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle&quot;&gt;KISS principle&lt;/a&gt; is good.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;ClaudiaJS, AWS Lambda and DynamoDB are really cool technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;One doesn‚Äòt get the telegram users timezone for free, you have to ask for location permission and
        resolve it with a third party service or ask directly for it (as I did here), which is weird, because a
        lot of people do not know their timezone.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t expect anyone to use your bot, because of finding it coincidentally. Marketing a telegram bot is
        hard and
        reduced to the group of telegram users (surprise)!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Take a lot of time to explain the purpose of the bot really well. &lt;a
            href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well&quot;&gt;It should do only
            one thing really well&lt;/a&gt; and creating another bot for other things is free.&lt;/li&gt;

    A long time ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammurabi&quot;&gt;King Hammurabi of Babylonia&lt;/a&gt;,
    wrote a
    code of law,
    the so called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi&quot;&gt;Code of Hammurabi&lt;/a&gt;,
    which holds some surprisingly effective thoughts regarding the contract between a landlord and a house
    builder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    ‚ÄûIf a builder build a house for a man and complete it, (that man) shall give him two shekels of silver
    per
    SAK [a length unit] of house as his wage.‚Äú [1]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    A bigger house costs more money. But isn‚Äòt it interesting, how the house builder is not paid depending
    on
    the time it took to build it?
    There is no hourly rate, which means, the landlord wont get any unhappy financial surprises, which is
    good.
    But wait a second!
    Doesn‚Äòt that mean, that a house builder will do anything as fast and cheap as possible, wouldn&apos;t that be
    a
    catastrophy?
    He might put those people in danger, who want to live in this house later on.
    The key question is: How can the owner of the house assure, that it has a good quality, if he only pays
    depending on the size of the house?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    Hammurabi thought about this, did some risk management, and solved this ‚Äûquick and dirty‚Äú approach by
    the
    following law:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    ‚ÄûIf a builder build a house for a man and do not make its construction firm, and the house which he has
    built collapse and cause the death of the owner of the house,
    that builder shall be put to death. If it cause the death of a son of the owner of the house, they shall
    put
    to death a son of that builder.‚Äú [2]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    There is no need to explain, that the house builders will do their absolute best to prevent houses to
    collapse and kill someone,
    because they have so much skin in the game for an unlimited amount of time, meaning they can be killed
    because a house collapsed, they built 20 years ago.
    How exactly assured Hammurabi the quality of houses? By closing a feedback loop for the craftmanship of
    house building.
    Those who are really good at building houses will be able to keep building houses, while those who fail
    doing that will be stopped putting peoples live in danger.
    It might sound like a cruel practice from our modern cultural perspective, but it led to ridiculously
    good
    houses, there is no doubt.

    The house building quality solution is not a solution for house building anymore, maybe because of
    technological advancement and regulations,
    but I believe we can learn a lot from Hammurabis structural solution here. He shows us, that we need to
    close the feedback loop and reduce its complexity.
    This is, in my opinion, the single most important task of agile software processes.
    What I mean goes far beyond &lt;a
        href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/enterprise-strategy/enterprise-devops-why-you-should-run-what-you-build/&quot;&gt;‚ÄûYou
        build it, you run it.‚Äú&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    One example: A software architect, who does architectural work on a project and then leaves over to the
    next
    project, has zero skin in the game of the old project, and is therefore hardly able to improve.
    In a frictionless world, this architect would maybe get verbal feedback from people on the lower
    technical
    levels, that experience the actual haptical feedback that result from his decisions.
    But in the real world, complexity, reputation and hierarchy fog this verbal feedback, which complicates
    improvement for the architect further.
    And this is just one example for the concept of closed feedback loops, and therefore having skin in the
    game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    Lets enhance our motto: ‚ÄûYou build it, you run it .. and you bleed for it.‚Äú, where bleeding is
    metaphorical
    for all the (negative) consequences that result from our decisions.
    It may be a phone call in the middle of the night, it may be doing overtime that originates in our own
    mistakes or might be getting fired.
    Especially the last point might sound extreme on the first glance, but think about this on a theoretical
    level first:
    Do you really want to build a team, in which people don&apos;t experience negative feedback on their own
    actions?
    Do you prefer working with people who survived the sometimes brutal reality, or would you rather work
    with
    people that have set up (and used!) safety nets a little too often?
    Please get this right: I am all for improvement that is based and being able to fail and learn. In order
    to
    be able to innovate, it is crucial to have playgrounds with limited consequences to failure.
    On the other hand I am worried, that an extensive lack of consequences will lead weak software
    craftsmen,
    who build houses that collapse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    And, of course, be aware! Don‚Äòt let someone else put YOUR skin in HIS game. It has happend more than
    once,
    that a release plan, that was promised by a project manager led to overtime for engineers,
    or that product owners are blamed for quality issues, that were caused by ‚ÄûI will fix it later‚Äú minded
    engineers.

    This post discusses the segregation of responsibility of an increment between technical people and
    business
    people. I experienced a very unclear understanding of this topic on both sides,
    which usually leads to wrong decisions and poor quality. I believe the proposed model will lead to a
    better
    sense of responsibility and therefore greater results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    Lets start by some definitions: An increment can be everything between a whole product, that was
    developed
    for years to a small feature that was developed in the last iteration/sprint.
    It has many dimensions. For this model we need only two of them: the business perspective (also referred
    to
    as functional), and the technical perspective.

    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/increment_dimensions.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;

    Business people are those that work on the business perspective of an increment, by defining and
    refining
    the problem, doing business research, talking to stakeholders etc;
    they answer the &quot;what?&quot;. In scrum these are the product owners (POs). Technical people on the other hand
    are
    those who tackle the technical perspective on an increment.
    They develop a solution to a problem, by answering the &quot;how?&quot;. And they work in a team, why not call
    them
    &quot;tech team&quot; for this article.

    If the tech team says, they want to do a technical task that does not directly provide business value,
    but
    is necessary to keep the system alive, what should happen?
    Should the product owner agree to do it?

    The tech team as a whole is responsible for everything that happens on the technical dimension,
    including a
    sufficient level of quality (&quot;We do not deliver Shyt!&quot;), operations and security issues.
    Other examples are architectural, programming language and cloud platform related decisions, and there
    are
    many more.
    Since it is &quot;their&quot; solution to the problem, you call the tech team in the middle of the night, when the
    software isn&apos;t running! Additionally, they are the only ones that know how to fix it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    Therefore, the business people should not actively agree to the technical task, that was mentioned
    earlier;
    they shouldn&apos;t bother at all!
    The questions that are asked on the business dimension are often similar to &quot;What do we need to do?&quot;,
    &quot;What
    is our (functional!) priority?&quot;, &quot;When will we be done with this stage of the backlog?&quot;
    and &quot;Should I take this as one feature, or rather split it into two?&quot;. The business people should decide
    everything, that belongs to the business perspective, and shouldn&apos;t decide anything that does not
    belong to that dimension. If they would do the latter, they would take away the responsibility of
    people,
    who are better at doing that, which is a guarantuee for a loss of value from a
    wholesome standpoint. The business peoples decision making power starts and ends at business
    questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    This is a very clean and structural (and massively simplified!) solution to a typically &quot;unclean&quot;
    problem.
    I have worked with engineers who believe, it isn&apos;t their responsibility to take actions on technical
    topics,
    because they do not feel responsibile. The technical debt piles up, which leads to quality issues and
    paralyzation in the development process. But they want to get told by the business people,
    or at least get allowance, to deliver good quality. That is not what being a craftsman and taking
    responsibility looks like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    On the other side, I have seen customers and managers, who believe that the business people are
    responsible
    for everything, even technical things like architecture and quality.
    And of course, as common as the &quot;unresponsible engineer&quot; is the &quot;I-will-take-it-all-business-person&quot;,
    who
    wants to decide on huge technical decisions or backlog items based on a two minute explanation.
    This persons often &quot;allows&quot; the tech team to decide on the smaller issues, because he &quot;trusts&quot; them with
    that. He mixes up the two given dimensions of an increment with importance or size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    To make this more clear, think of the following example: As a member of the tech team, I have to keep my
    operating system up to date and secure all the time. On the long term, there
    is no way around it in order to be able to develop a feature, and I am responsible to do this. The very
    important question here is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;b&gt;Why am I responsible for doing this very small technical thing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    Is it because it is a technical thing to do, or is it, because it is a small thing? If the answer is the
    former: Great. Scale that up. You don&apos;t need to read this any further.
    If the answer is, because it is a quick and small thing, than you have that unclean structural problem
    that
    was mentioned above.
    There is no exact way in determining beforehand if a task is above or below a given threshold in size,
    complexity, importance, criticality etc. It is a subjective and discussable thing,
    that depends on experience, perspective and even the mood of people. At this point one could be tempted
    to
    think: &quot;If it is close to that threshold,
    I will know if it is in my area of responsibility or not.&quot;. Yes, you might, but someone else might have
    a
    different perception, and this relies by far to much on that subjective metric.
    A very clear segregation in responsibility, between the business perspective and the technical
    perspective
    (and people who are well aware of it)
    is a good thing that leads to great results in software development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;b&gt;One is responsible who has the power to make decisions, is affected by the consequences and has to
        deal
        with the reaction to those.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    In order to embrace the segregation of responsibility, I propose that you start by cleaning up your
    backlog
    (or any other form of todo list you have).
    Group the items in &quot;functional&quot; and &quot;technical&quot;. If some items are on the edge between those two, focus
    on
    the functional aspects first and kick out the technical questions or decisions, they will follow.
    The functional items are the reign of the business people. If you are one of them: This is the area you
    can
    make decisions on,
    and you have to take the full responsibility for your decision. This is your area of influence, doing a
    great job here will be easier without having all those technical aspects in mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    Now have a look at all the technical items. What you see is the reign of tech team.
    If you are part of the tech team: This is what you decide and take the responsibility for. Ask yourself
    for
    every legacy item you have: Which problem does my technical item solve,
    and is that really necessary and relevant? Clean up and discuss it with the other tech team members. You
    have to see the whole picture (the beyond-sprint-perspective),
    because you will be accountable for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    Just to get this right. I am not proposing to reduce the communication between business people and
    technical
    people. As a technical person, it often is a good idea to challenge business requirements.
    The technical people will sometimes have to justify, why they decide for a specific framework or why you
    want to switch the programming language etc.
    But by all the technical decisions you do and execute, you should always (at least every iteration) also
    deliver things. Have in mind: the tools you use, are tools to solve a problem.
    Tools are not useful without a problem to solve. Talk to each other :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    One concern I have often heard: How can you take away the responsibilty for big and time consuming
    technical
    backlog items from the business people?
    They will need to meet agreements and make promises about release dates etc.! That is a valid question,
    and
    the answer is underwhelming:
    A technical decision is equally not in their responsibility, as protecting the engineers from getting
    hit by
    a bus.
    They simply cannot control it, and they shouldn&apos;t. At this point, business people have to let go the
    urge to
    control that and trust the tech team, which will deliver solutions,
    which will lead to more trust. It is an upward flywheel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    I hope that this clarification about the dimensions of an increment, that should be taken into
    consideration
    when taking responsibility for a software project in any role,
    helps to build highly valuable software with less stress for every involved person. Please keep in mind,
    that the more formal segregation I propse is no silver bullet.
    It is just a small piece in the big puzzle of software development, that can only work, if you have a
    non-broken tech team, that is abled and willing to take responsibility.
