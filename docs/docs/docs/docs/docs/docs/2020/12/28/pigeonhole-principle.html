    While learning for my discrete mathematics exam, I stumbled across the <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-mxYrCNX60">pigeonhole principle</a>. A pigeonhole is where
    pigeons like to sit. I started liking it, when I discovered, that it is so obvious in the metaphor but, at
    least for me, took a while to become able to really apply it. The pigeon metaphor goes like this:
    <br><br>
    <b>If there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one hole will host at least two pigeons.</b>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
    🐦&nbsp;--&nbsp;&nbsp;📭<br>
    🐦&nbsp;--&nbsp;&nbsp;📭<br>
    🐦&nbsp;--´<br>
</div>
<p>
    Obvious.
    <br><br>
    Please tell me <b>how many people in Sydney have the same amount of hair on their head?</b>
    Lets estimate the maximum amount of hair: 150K. In Sydney live around 5.3M people.
    <b>Preliminary conclusion</b>: At least 2 people in Sydney have the exact same amount of hair.
    <br><br>
    The pigeonhole principle goes further: It also tells us, how many people (at least) in Sydney have the same
    amount of hair. Just divide the pigeons by the pigeonholes and ceil the number.
    <br><br>
    5.3M / 150K ~= 35,3 ceiled to 36.
    <br><br>
    <b>Conclusion</b>: At least 36 people in Sydney have the exact same amount of hair.
    <br><br>
    I believe there are many real world situations, in which the pigeonhole principle makes a lot of sense, and
    I cannot wait to stumble across some of them. To be honest: For this example, it would be more effective to
    count (or estimate) the amount of bald people, assuming they are the biggest group with the same amount of
    hair.

    <b>Homework</b>: At my wedding we had 125 guests. There were 6 different main courses and 3 different side
    dishes,
    and each guest took one main course and one side dish on their plate. How many people at least had the exact
    same meal?
