    <p><strong>Doing agile:</strong> We do understand, that every team member is selfish, has poor communication skills and insufficient
knowledge to solve an undefined problem that everyone pretends to understand in a predictable amount of
time.</p>

<p>Therefore we are shifting the focus from believing the experts and their plans to learning, experimenting
and repeatedly checking something useful gets done. And we do test-driven SAFe T-shaped daily pair
programming Kanban with our Scrum PO.</p>

<p>P.S. We don‚Äôt do documentation, because we value working software more.</p>
