    <p>My younger brother tried to build a telegram bot, that gives him some information about his schedule,
so he started, but stuck due to some infrastructure problems. I attempted to help him,
and then basically took over the whole thing. I used claudia.js with its deployment and bot-builder
features,
and deployed it to AWS Lambda. Document based persistance happens using DynamoDB.</p>

<p>You can test the bot here (imagine you are still at school): <a href="http://t.me/MyScheduleRobot">t.me/MyScheduleRobot</a></p>

<p>Now some functional details: This bot is a schedule bot, it is not a calendar.
To make the difference, and therefore what it does and what it doesn‚Äôt, more clear:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Schedule</th>
      <th>Calendar</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Days repeat every week</td>
      <td>Days are different every week</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Timeslots repeat every day (üîî rings)</td>
      <td>Timeslots are vary a lot</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e8/ec/d1/e8ecd11f3c278afd7b3543a2b81fd1ea.png">Compare this</a></td>
      <td><a href="https://cdn.vertex42.com/calendars/images/monthly-calendar-with-combined-weekend.png">with this</a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>A short high-level summary is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Define all the subjects (plus room, teacher etc.) you have, the timeslots (that repeat every day) and your timezone</li>
  <li>Configure your schedule, that is e.g. which subject you have first on monday, which second etc.</li>
  <li>You get information for the whole week, just today, tomorrow or even now by chatting with the bot</li>
</ol>

<p>Use /help to get the detailed and always up-to-date list of things the bot can do.</p>

<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS principle</a> is good.</li>
  <li>ClaudiaJS, AWS Lambda and DynamoDB are really cool technologies.</li>
  <li>One doesn‚Äòt get the telegram users timezone for free, you have to ask for location permission and resolve it with a third party service or ask directly for it (as I did here), which is weird, because a lot of people do not know their timezone.</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt expect anyone to use your bot, because of finding it coincidentally. Marketing a telegram bot is hard and reduced to the group of telegram users (surprise)!</li>
  <li>Take a lot of time to explain the purpose of the bot really well. It should do only one thing really well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well) and creating another bot for other things is free.</li>
</ul>
